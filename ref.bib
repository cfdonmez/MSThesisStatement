abstract = {Summary Energy is the cornerstone of the existence and development of modern society. The energy consumption continues to increase, and the ensuing environmental pollution and increasing lack of traditional energy sources have also become the world's most concerned issues. The emergence of new energy has eased the current unfavorable situation. Among them, distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation has been favored because of its abundant resources and no geographical restrictions. However, due to the scattered construction of solar PV power stations, it is not easy to manage. Therefore, research and development of PV remote monitoring systems for unified monitoring and management of PV power stations. In addition, the problem of solar cell output efficiency is also an important reason that restricts the utilization of solar energy. Improving the output efficiency of the battery based on the existing solar cell conversion efficiency is also a focus of current research. Based on the above background, the research content of this article is the network communication monitoring system for distributed PV power generation systems. This article first conducts the overall design of the PV remote monitoring system, constructs the system's distributed design structure, and divides the underlying hardware part of the system into control modules and transmission. According to the application requirements, the STM32 series single-chip microcomputer is selected as the controller of the system control module and the transmission module. The hardware circuit design and software process implementation of the system are studied to realize the data collection, MPPT control, and remote data transmission of the photovoltaic system. Features: Finally, through experimental simulation, it was verified that the light intensity increased from 600 to 800 W/m2, and the output current of the inverter increased accordingly. The output current of the distributed PV power generation system was directly proportional to the change of the light intensity. The designed system is feasible.},
